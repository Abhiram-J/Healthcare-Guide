# Healthcare-Guide
Hi guys , 
We have made a website which is a one stop destination for all your 
health problems mainly related to COVID-19 . Hope this website helps you .
Steps to open website :
1. Download the zip file named hackx_project
2. Extract it 
3. Open the hackx_project folder
4. Open the ' index.html ' file using any web browser
5. You can view the hyperlinks by sliding your cursor over the index page images and clicking on them .
  Thank you

NB:
As this website contains  hyperlinks so it is only possible to view the index page from the site link provided below 
 https://abhiram-j.github.io/Healthcare-Guide/
This is because we can only host one page at a time from github pages so the hyperlinks wont work .
